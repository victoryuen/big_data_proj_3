## Part 1

### Question

(Readin file) Goto the following website to download the Breast Cancer Dataset. Read the CSV file into panda data frame. You can choose any data structure type to store the values (pandas Or Mat-Lab). 32 features (or columns).

### Output

(N/A)

## Part 2

### Question

 (data cleaning / Preparation) Remove any row which contain empty cell(s) ”Bad Data.” Split the dataset into training set (80%) and testing (20%)


### Output

(N/A)

## Part 3

### Question

(Modeling and Evaluations) Train the dataset on the Decision Tree Classifier using the training set (Track the training time). Draw the decision Tree. Evaluate your trained model using the testing data. How well does your model perform? Use performance metrics, like accuracy, sensitivity and specificity (recall). Visualize the confusion Matrix.

## Part 4

### Question

 (Modeling and Evaluations) Train the dataset on the Support Vector Machine (RBF) Classifier (Track the training time). Evaluate your trained model using the testing data. How well does your model perform? Use performance metrics, like accuracy, sensitivity and specificity (recall). Visualize the confusion Matrix

### Output

## Part 6

### Question

Find the feature importance using Random Forest Method (link provided in reference section)
- Visualize the top two columns (feature) in x-y coordinate system.
- Remove the feature with the lowest importance and retrain your model using Decision Tree. Draw Decision and Evaluate performance of the model. Track the training time.
- Remove the four features with the lowest importances and retrain your model using Decision Tree. Draw Decision tree and Evaluate performance of the model. Track the training time. 
- Remove the ten features with the lowest importances and retrain your model using Decision Tree. Draw Decision tree and Evaluate performance of the model. Track the training time.

## Part 7

### Question

(Analysis and Discussions)
- Which model (from Q3 to Q6) performed the best?
- Does removing least important features speed up training times?
- Does removing least important features lower performance of your model?
- How does removing less important features relevant to Big Data (extremely large dataset)?

### Response
