# ML Sklearn Project README

## Project Overview

This project involves training and evaluating machine learning models using the Scikit-learn library. The focus is on breast cancer data, where various classification algorithms, such as Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are applied. The project includes steps for data extraction, model training, feature importance analysis, and visualization.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key files:

1. `main.py`: The main script to run the project.
2. `data_extraction.py`: Handles data loading and preprocessing.
3. `model_training.py`: Contains functions for training and evaluating models.
